    "name": "Quality Assessment in the Tower of Babel",
    "description": "Source control systems like Git, TFS, or SVN store silently meta-data about our development activity. Currently, this wealth of historical information about projects is mostly ignored.\n\nDuring this session we will prove that these meta-data can reveal a lot about the quality of your code base but also your development process. We introduce a highly innovative yet intriguingly simple approach by which source control meta-data is used to assess the quality of a software system without actually analysing the code itself. In fact, the biggest benefit of this approach is that it breaks the constraints of language-dependent analysis techniques and tools: all source files are analysed together independent of their programming language, and quality issues are reported even for files that are ignored by traditional code quality tools (e.g. configuration files, SQL files)\n\nIn this session we will demonstrate how a multitude of anti-patterns can be detected strictly based on the source-control meta-data. We will show detection techniques referring to unusual patterns of change, like files with a sudden growth or a high frequency of changes, files with insufficient amount of refactoring, etc. We will also discuss how team anomalies can be detected (e.g. unstable teams, too many developers working at the same time on the same file, or files with a high risk of knowledge loss due to developers having left the project).\n\nFurthermore, we will see how source-control meta-data can be used to get quickly a rough understanding of an unknown code base; this includes an overview of the technologies being used, the dynamics of the project’s team, the developers that have the best understanding of the system, and the quality hotspots of a project. We will also show how information visualisation techniques can help us to explore efficiently this wealth of data, for example the distribution of anti-patterns or technologies across the system.",

Newest SQL Server 2016 is installed on one of our servers, but we still have 2014 and some older versions.\nIn my session I will focus on implementation of encryption methods and techniques which we can use for improve security of our data with SQL Server 2016 and Azure Cloud Services, as well comparing previous options for earlier version of SQL Server. Implementation of TDE (Transparent Data Encryption), Always Encrypted and DDM (Dynamic Data Masking) for Enterprise Architecture, symmetric or asymmetric encryption, DES, 3DES, AES and other algorithms. Finally best and worst practice for implementation. And price list for all of those stuff.",

In large software projects where many developers work on the same code base one of the biggest challenge is to get consistency in code, to create development patterns for common problems, so you can control the complexity and size of the system.\nIn this session I will show how we can achieve consistency through structure, rather then relying on discipline only. We will look at some basic building blocks of an application infrastructure which will enforce the way dependencies are created, how dependency injection is used or how separation of the data access concerns is enforced.",

What about other places where credentials are stored and what are the best practices for avoiding passwords issues and preventing different attacks? During this session, Paula will touch on: the technology weaknesses and situations where o take passwords from the operating system to perform several operations, the unexpected places your passwords reside and how the password attacks are performed and the typical paths for credentials to leak.

    "description": "Each year the IT world offers a hype-word. The last decade has all been about mobile, cloud, Big Data and IoT. In the context of cloud apps however, monolithic applications have little to offer in terms of HA and DR and their deployment process is mostly an error-prone operation. Curious enough, even though container have been around for many years, the hype word nowadays is containers (along with microservices), and that’s probably because of Docker, who made containers really easy to use.\nThroughout this talk, I will cover the importance of containers and what Azure has to offer in terms of containers, namely Azure Container Services. And because deploying a single container isn’t part of the real world scenarios, I will also show you how you can manage (aka orchestrate) an application in the real world. Don’t be fooled by the title though! This session will not be exclusively about Docker, it will be about containers, about Docker images, about orchestrating containerized applications, about Azure Container Service, about deploying ASP.NET Core Applications to Docker Containers in Azure and about configuring release pipelines in Visual Studio Team Services and taking advantage of Docker containers.",

Some have pictures, some with just witty comments. Though all three will come more importantly with ways that would have stopped me from being successful. The goal is not to show how ‘L337’ I am or these attacks are!

    "name": "Automated dynamic firmware analysis at scale: a case study on embedded web interfaces",
    "description": "Embedded devices are becoming more widespread, interconnected, and web-enabled than ever. However, recent studies showed that these devices are far from being secure. Moreover, many embedded systems rely on web interfaces for user interaction or administration. Unfortunately, web security is known to be difficult, and therefore the web interfaces of embedded systems represent a considerable attack surface.\nIn this talk, Andrei will show the first fully automated framework that applies dynamic firmware analysis techniques to achieve, in a scalable manner, automated vulnerability discovery within embedded firmware images. We apply our framework to study the security of embedded web interfaces running in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) embedded devices, such as routers, DSL/cable modems, VoIP phones, IP/CCTV cameras. We introduce a methodology and implement a scalable framework for discovery of vulnerabilities in embedded web interfaces regardless of the vendor, device, or architecture. To achieve this goal, our framework performs full system emulation to achieve the execution of firmware images in a software-only environment, i.e., without involving any physical embedded devices. Then, we analyze the web interfaces within the firmware using both static and dynamic tools. He will also present some interesting case studies, and discuss the main challenges associated with the dynamic analysis of firmware images and their web interfaces and network services. The observations we make in this paper shed light on an important aspect of embedded devices which was not previously studied at a large scale. Insights from this session can help users, programmers and auditors in efficiently testing and securing their Internet-enabled embedded devices.",

Although it is not entirely clear today what a data scientist is, there are some common characteristics which almost everybody agrees upon. For example, everybody agrees that data scientists need a strong background in computer science and apps, modeling, statistics, math, and analytics. There is also a consensus that data scientists need to be able to communicate with both business people and technical people. And of course, they have to work with huge amounts of data coming from a large number of data sources.\nThroughout this session we will discuss about the specifics of today’s “data science” discipline. The main focus of the discussion will be on how is data analysis being revolutionized by cloud computing. We will provide specific technical examples on how platforms and tools from Microsoft Azure enable the modern data scientist to cope with the ever increasing amounts of data and ever changing business requirements.",

    "name": "The fine art of Time Travelling: implementing Event Sourcing",
    "description": "If there is a common practice in architecting software systems, it is to have them store the last known state of business entities in a relational database: though widely adopted and effectively supported by existing development tools, this practice trades the easiness of implementation with the cost of losing the history of such entities.\nEvent Sourcing provides a pivotal solution to this problem, giving systems the capability of restoring the state they had at any given point in time. Furthermore, injecting mock-up events and having them replayed by the business logic allows for an easy implementation of simulations and “what if” scenarios.\nIn this session, Andrea will demonstrate how to design time travelling systems by examining real-world, production-tested solutions.",
